# basicDAST

A basic Dynamic Application Security Tool. It began for intern project in JotForm and it will become personal project.

For now divided into seperate files, in the future it will be integrated into one file.

To run, it needs the parameters and payloads in text files.

# Note

It is far from complete and there could be some drawbacks or problems.
